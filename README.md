FunSftp
=======

FunSftp is a ruby gem that provides a nice and easy to use wrapper for the Net::SFTP library.

Reference: [net-sftp](http://net-ssh.github.com/sftp/v2/api/index.html)

Installation
------------

```ruby
gem 'fun_sftp'
```

Usage
-----

Let's say you need to send a file or directory to a remote host. Well, you can upload it to the remote host via the following:

Setup the connection and specify a `source` directory if desired:

```ruby
include FunSftp
conn = SFTPClient.new(server, username, password)
# For authentication via keys
conn = SFTPClient.new(server, username, password, keys: [/path/to/key], host_key: 'ssh-rsa')
conn.source = 'projects/awesome_project' #optional
```

Changing directories `chdir` and listing all files `ll` can be useful when working in a console. FunSftp now allows you to change your location on the remote host. This saves you from constantly entering long absolute paths.

```ruby
conn.chdir("projects")
# Changes Directory
# => "Current Path changed to => ./projects"

conn.ll
# Lists all files in current location
# => file1
#    file2
#    Directory1
#    Directory2

conn.pwd
# Returns the current working directory
# => "./projects"
```

If you need to start from scratch then reset to the base path:

```ruby
conn.reset_path!
# => "Path Reset!"
```

Now, you can upload your file:

```ruby
conn.upload!("my_local_file_name.txt", "some_remote_directory/give_a_name.txt")
```

or directory

```ruby
conn.upload!("my_awesome_local_directory", "desired_remote_directory_name")
```

That's it! Check the remote host to see that your file posted.

You can also download a remote file to your local machine:

```ruby
conn.download!("some_remote_directory/file_to_download_name.txt", "desired_local_name.txt")
```

or directory

```ruby
conn.download!("some_remote_directory", "desired_local_directory_name")
```

Need to read a file on the remote host? Ah, it's no biggie...

```ruby
conn.read("path/to/file_name.txt")
# => Hello World!
```

It is also possible to read the attributes size, access time and modified time.

```ruby
conn.size("path/to/file_name.txt")
# => 1413455562
# works also for directories

conn.atime("path/to/file_name.txt")
# => 2014-10-16 12:32:42 +0200

conn.mtime("path/to/file_name.txt")
#=> 2014-10-16 12:32:42 +0200
```

When investigating items on the remote host, these commands can be handy:

```ruby
conn.has_directory?("directory_name")
# returns true or false if the directory exists

conn.entries("directory_name")
# outputs a nice array of entries in the specified directory
# Pass true as a second argument if you would like to see '.' files
# => ["test1", "test2", "some_directory_here"]

conn.items_in("directory_name")
# Traverses the provided directory returning an array of directories and files
# => ["test1", "test1/h1.rb", "test2", "test2/h2.txt"]

conn.print_directory_items("directory_name")
# a print out of contained directories/files one line at a time
# => test1.txt
#    test2.png
#    fun_directory_1

conn.glob("directory_name", "**/*.rb")
# Traverses the directory specified using the second argument/matcher
# So, you can get things like...
# => ["some_directory_here/hello_world.rb", "sftp_is_fun.rb"]
```

FileUtils
---------

FileUtilities are handy for doing some dirty work on the remote host.

So far, you can make/remove directories, remove/rename files

```ruby
conn.mkdir!("new_directory_name_here")
```

Removing a directory is the same as above except you would swap mkdir! for rmdir!:

```ruby
conn.rmdir!("directory_name_to_remove")
```

Files can be removed and renamed off the remote host:

```ruby
conn.rm("file.txt")

conn.rename("old_file_name.txt", "new_file_name.txt")
# old_file_name.txt is now named new_file_name.txt on the remote host.
```

Hopefully, this is easy enough to work with and transfer files!!

Logging
-------

By default, logging is turned on and will use the Rails logger if within a Rails projects. If not logging will defer to STDOUT. Logging is prominent when downloading or uploading. To turn off logging, you can create an initializer and modify the configuration by:

```ruby
FunSftp.configure do |config|
  config.log = false
end
```

You can also define your own logger if you'd like.

```ruby
FunSftp.configure do |config|
  config.logger = MyAwesomeLogger.new
end
```
